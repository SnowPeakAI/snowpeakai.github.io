## ðŸ‘‹ About Me  
I am Guillaume Vidot Damour, the founder of SnowPeak AI.
With a PhD focused on the robustness of embedded ML systems at **Airbus**, where I also worked on AI-driven aircraft navigation, and experience enhancing security video analysis at **Foxstream**, I have refined my skills in building reliable, high-impact AI solutions.  
Now, with SnowPeak AI, I am combining my expertise in ML and passion for trustworthy AI to deliver cutting-edge solutions that make a real difference. I am committed to bridging the gap between theory and practical impact, always learning and evolving to stay ahead.
